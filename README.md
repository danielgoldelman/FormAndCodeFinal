# Form And Code Final
## Explanation of the Project

I decided to expand on the second short project for my final. I already had the capability to transform a circle into points and manipulate the distances between points. Now it remained to accurately describe the process by which someone else could recreate my outputs and generate their own unique shapes by using the tools I built. 

In addition to this, I defined new unique shapes and manipulated my tools to produce interesting creations and show the possibilities for this kind of tooling. 

## Folder-Level Explanation

- `final project`: This contains my final project. See below for details
    - `Base Files`: These are the [Rhino](https://www.rhino3d.com/) and [Grasshopper](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/) files by which every other document was created
    - `Examples`: This holds the various outputs that my Grasshopper code and Rhino manipulation generated
        - `Basics`: There are a few base shapes contained in folders here that show basic outputs of the generation from the Grasshopper file
        - `English`: Recreation of the English alphabet using the code
        - `Symbol Animations`: A few quick animations of how the running Grasshopper code works
- *LISCENSE* : MIT liscense
- *README.md* : This file 

## So, how should you navigate this repository?

In each major directory listed above, there is a markdown file that will explain the specifics of the documents contained within the folder. Reading that file will assist with understanding how to interpret and possibly recreate my outputs.

Start with the `Base Files` directory and then proceed to any folder within `Examples` that you choose. Have fun!
