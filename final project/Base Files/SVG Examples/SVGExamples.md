# SVG Examples

1. Find an SVG and download it
2. Drag the SVG into *setup.3dm*
3. When the pop-up opens, select "Import file"
4. When the next pop-up opens, deselect "Retain grouping" and "Group multi curve paths", and select "Curves".
5. Resize the curves according to how you desire, place them into the bounding circle, and proceed as described earlier.

*gear.mov* shows all of these steps when applied to one curve.

*gear_2_curves.mov* shows how to apply these steps to two curves.

*gear-svgrepo-com.svg* is the SVG used in the two videos, and can be found in *setup.3dm*
