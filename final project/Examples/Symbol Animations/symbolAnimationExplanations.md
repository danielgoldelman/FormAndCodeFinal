# Symbol Animations

This directory houses a few folders containing videos describing the creation of a few interesting outputs from basic shapes. Each of the shapes apart from `Mult Check` was a religious symbol. 

For `Cross`, `Star of David`, and `Ying Yang`, Rhino animation was applied to the multiplier number slider in the original Grasshopper function. Each base shape had been set in the bounding circle. The animation had been set to capture 100 images of the progression from 1 to 10 multiplication. The generated .bmp images were then compiled into videos, with each image being allotted 0.1 seconds in the video. Within their directories, you can find the video, a picture of the original and generated shape, and the original photos created via Rhino animation. The base files for these creations are located in the `Setups` folder.

It is very important to recognize that animating the "Count Dividers" slider is not a possibility. Go and try it! Changing that slider will populate the layer with more and more points, and very weird interactions occur. Thus, it is not possible to animate that slider, the result of which yields outputs like you can see in `Mult Check`.
